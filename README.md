##Description
---
OpenCppSAU (**O**pen source **C**++ **S**imulated **A**nnealing **U**tility).
A C++ based open source simulated annealing module.

This utility is almost identical to [OpenFSAM](https://github.com/nfherrin/OpenFSAM) so the documentation is identical with one following note:
  1. Unlike OpenFSAM, OpenCppSAU REQUIRES that `<sa_object>.size_states` be specified by the user due to the way in which C++ treats array pointers.
